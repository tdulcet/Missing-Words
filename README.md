# Missing words in the Mozilla English dictionary
Missing words in the Mozilla (Firefox and Thunderbird) American English (en-US) language spellchecking dictionary.

Copyright © 2022 Teal Dulcet

The [Mozilla English dictionary](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/extensions/spellcheck/) is based on the [SCOWL dictionary](http://wordlist.aspell.net/), which is also used by Chromium, LibreOffice and many other open source projects, but unfortunately, it is missing many common words found in other proprietary dictionaries. I created this in an effort to help Mozilla developers and other Mozillians systematically find those missing words that should be included in the Mozilla and other spellchecking dictionaries.
